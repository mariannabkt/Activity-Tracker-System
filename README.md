# Activity Tracker System

## Overview
The **Activity Tracker System** is a multi-user mobile application and backend system designed for analyzing exercise data from GPX files. The system leverages a TCP-based Java server and a MapReduce framework to efficiently process user-uploaded activity data, providing key metrics like total distance, average speed, total elevation gain, and overall exercise time. Users can also compare their statistics with others through the Android application.

## Features
- **Mobile Application**: Allows users to upload GPX files and view detailed exercise statistics.
- **Backend System**: Processes user-uploaded GPX files using a multi-threaded, TCP-based Java server.
- **MapReduce Framework**: Efficiently analyzes large GPX files by splitting them into smaller chunks processed in parallel.
- **Real-Time Stats**: Users can track personal performance metrics and compare their results with average stats.
- **Leaderboards**: Users can track their performance on predefined route segments and view leaderboards for each segment.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For the backend server and multi-threaded processing of GPX files.
- **Android**: For the mobile interface where users can upload GPX files and view results.
- **MapReduce**: For parallel processing of large data files.
- **TCP Sockets**: For communication between the mobile app and the backend server.

## How It Works
1. The **mobile app** allows users to select a GPX file from their device and upload it to the backend system for processing.
2. The **backend system** is implemented as a TCP server that receives GPX files, splits them into chunks (waypoints), and processes each chunk using the MapReduce model.
3. The **Map** phase computes intermediate results for each chunk, including distance, speed, elevation, and time.
4. The **Reduce** phase combines intermediate results from all chunks to generate final statistics for the userâ€™s activity.
5. The processed data is sent back to the mobile app for display, showing metrics such as total distance, average speed, total elevation gain, and total time.
